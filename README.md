# Calculo Sed Ergo Sum

=======

Calculo Sed Ergo Sum (CSES) is a fancy name I claim the paternity and thus I use in several projects related to machine learning and robotics.
So CSES inted to be a global project for AI and robotics. Actually, I don't know exactly what it is about. But it definitely has a cool name !


## Currently :
- Sketch of a color-tracking program on the video stream from webcam, using OpenCV. Not completely working (but not that bad).
- Next step : SFML-based GUI face that look at the most recognized colored object
- Next+1 step : 3-axis servo control of the camera to center the colored object in the field of view.
